    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is the best gyros</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ medium onion, cut into chunks</li>
      <li>1 pound ground lamb</li>
      <li>1 pound 80/20 ground beef</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground dried rosemary</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground dried thyme</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>1½ teaspoons fine sea salt</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pulse onion in a food processor until finely chopped, about 5 (1-second)
        pulses. Scoop onions onto the center of a towel, gather up the towel
        ends, and squeeze to remove liquid
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine onions, lamb, beef, garlic, oregano, cumin, marjoram, rosemary,
        thyme, pepper, and salt in a large bowl. Mix with your hands until well
        combined. Cover and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours to allow the flavors to
        blend.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Evenly coat a
        7x4-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working in 2 batches if necessary, place meat mixture into a food
        processor and pulse until finely chopped and the texture feels tacky,
        about 1 minute. Transfer mixture into prepared loaf pan, and pack down
        to make sure there are no air pockets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line a medium roasting pan with a damp kitchen towel. Place the loaf pan
        in the center of the towel-lined roasting pan, and transfer it into the
        preheated oven. Carefully pour boiling water into the roasting pan until
        it comes halfway up the sides of the loaf pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until gyro meat is no longer pink in the
        center, about 1 hour to 1 hour 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees
        C)
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour off any accumulated fat, and allow to cool slightly before slicing
        thinly and serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
